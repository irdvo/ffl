( log = Logging module )
( The log module implements a software logging and tracing module.           )
( The module uses 6 different log events, from low to high: trace, debug,    )
( info, warning, error and fatal. All log events will generate a log         )
( mesage. Only the fatal log event will do an abort. A log message shows the )
( date and time, the log event and the actual message. The log events can be )
( skipped during compilation and suppressed during execution. This is done   )
( by setting the log level with the log-level word. All log events that are  )
( equal or higher then this level will be compiled c.q. accepted. All events )
( can be skipped by setting log.none to the log level.                       )
( A log message can be sent to one of the four so called appenders. The      )
( default appender is the console. This appender is also used if one of the  )
( file appenders is not able to write to a file. The second appender is a    )
( normal text file. The third type appender is a rolling file appender. This )
( appender writes a number of log messages to the first file, then moves to  )
( the next file and writes again a number of log messages, and so on, until  )
( the number of files is reached. Then the appender starts again with the    )
( first file. The calling word provides the base filename for the rolling    )
( filename. The logging module appends ".1", ".2" and so on for the          )
( different filenames. The last appender is the callback appender. With this )
( appender the calling module can process the messages by its own. The stack )
( notation for the callback word is: [ c-addr u -- ]                         )
