\ Example 1: buffering characters strings


\ Create the lineair buffer in the dictionary with an initial size of 10 chars

1 chars 10 lbf-create char-buf


\ Put characters in the buffer

s" Hello" char-buf lbf-set

\ Get the length of the stored characters

.( Number characters in buffer:) char-buf lbf-length@ . cr

\ Put more characters in the buffer, resulting a a resize of the buffer

s" , a nice morning to you." char-buf lbf-set


\ Get characters from the buffer

.( Read the buffer:) 29 char-buf lbf-get type cr



\ Example 2: buffering compound data: pair of cells as element


\ Create the lineair buffer on the heap with an initial size of 3 elements

2 cells 3 lbf-new value xy-buf


\ Set the store and fetch words for the buffer

' 2! ' 2@ xy-buf lbf-access!


\ Use the buffer as fifo buffer, using the store and fetch words

1 2 xy-buf lbf-enqueue
3 4 xy-buf lbf-enqueue
5 6 xy-buf lbf-enqueue
7 8 xy-buf lbf-enqueue       \ Buffer is resized

\ Get the length of the stored elements in the buffer

.( Number elements in buffer:) xy-buf lbf-length@ . cr

\ Get first element from buffer

.( First pair in buffer:) xy-buf lbf-dequeue [IF]
  .  . cr
[ELSE]
  .(  nothing in buffer) cr
[THEN]


\ Use the buffer as lifo buffer, using the store and fetch words

\ Get last pair from buffer

.( Last pair in buffer:) xy-buf lbf-pop [IF]
  . . cr
[ELSE]
  .(  nothing in buffer) cr
[THEN]

\ Free the buffer from the heap

xy-buf lbf-free
