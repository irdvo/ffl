                     The Forth Foundation Library (FFL)
                     ----------------------------------


The Forth Foundation Library is a general purpose forth library. It gives you
a collection of words written in (ANS) Forth, in areas such as data types,
collections, development support, interfaces and more modules. The
library is developped with gforth.

At the moment the library is still under development. The FFL library and the test 
words are licensed under the GNU GPL.


Installation
------------

Copy the directory 'ffl' and its contents to directory where the forth
system will look for sources. 

In case of gforth the 'ffl' directory should be copied to:


Testing
-------

After installing the sources files the unit test sources in the 'test'
directory  can be started by (for gforth):

gforth ffl_test.fs

The program will tell you which modules are tested and if there are any
errors. If you sell: 'Forth Foundation Modules Test: 0 errors in xxx tests.'
than all went well.


Using the library
-----------------




Porting to other forth systems
------------------------------

The library is developped with gforth. The intention is that only two files
are dependant of the forth system:

 ./ffl/config.fs
 ./ffl/make.fs

All other source files should use ANS words or extensions that are definied
in the config.fs.

If you change these files to make the library work on a certain forth system,
let me know, then I can add the changed files to the distribution. Also if
there are any specific details concerning installation or testing for a 
perticular forth system, let me know. I will add it in the README.


Bugs
----

Because the library is still alpha it is not impossible that you will find bugs. 
You can send them or any suggestions to the email address which is listed 
on the site: ffl.dvoudheusden.net. This is also the place for new versions, news, 
documentation etc.

Thanks.
