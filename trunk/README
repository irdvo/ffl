                     The Forth Foundation Library (FFL)
                     ----------------------------------


The Forth Foundation Library is a general purpose forth library. It gives you
a collection of words written in (ANS) Forth, in areas such as data types,
collections, development support, interfaces and compound modules. The
library is developped with gforth and pfe.

At the moment the library is still under development. The FFL library, the 
example and test files are licensed under the GNU GPL.


Installation
------------

Copy the directory 'ffl' and its contents to directory where the forth
system will look for sources. 


In case of gforth the 'ffl' directory (and its contents) should be copied to:

/usr/share/gforth/site-forth or /usr/local/share/gforth/site-forth


In case of bigforth the 'ffl' directory (and its contents) should be copied to:

/usr/lib/bigforth/src or /usr/local/lib/bigforth/src


In case of pfe the 'ffl' directory (and its contents) should be copied to:

/usr/share/pfe or /usr/local/share/pfe


In case of Win32Forth the 'ffl' directory (and its contents) should be
copied to:

<drive>:\Program Files\Win32Forth

(with <drive> the drive where Win32 is installed, normally this is 'C', or 
in a directory that is in the search path of Win32Forth.)


In case of minForth the 'ffl' directory (and its contents) should be 
copied to your forth working directory.


In case of iForth the 'ffl' directory (and its contents) should be copied to:
$IFORTH/include  ( ending up as $IFORTH/include/ffl ).

The ffl-0.6.0 directory, minus the subdirectory ffl, should be placed in 
$IFORTH/examples/ .


In case of spf the 'ffl' directory (and its contents) should be 
copied to the installation directory of spf. Normally this will be: 
C:\Program Files\SP-Forth .

Add in the 'spf4.ini' file (also normally in C:\Program Files\SP-Forth) the
following code (case is important):
  : include
    PARSE-NAME 2>R  2R@ + 0 SWAP C!  2R@ INCLUDE-PROBE IF
      2R> +ModuleDirName INCLUDED
    ELSE
      2R> 2DROP
    THEN
  ;


If your forth only looks in the current directory for forth sources, then copy 
the directory 'ffl' and its contents to the current directory.

Note: at this moment (2006-06-11) fina is not yet released, so any
installation and configuration directives are not possible. The config.fs
file for fina is also preliminary.


Configuration
-------------

The default config.fs and make.fs are for gforth. So no further copying is 
necessary for gforth.


For bigforth the config.fs and make.fs files should be copied from the
'engines/bigforth' directory to the 'ffl' directory.

For pfe the config.fs and make.fs files should be copied from the 
'engines/pfe' directory to the 'ffl' directory.

For Win32Forth the config.fs and make.fs files should be copied from the
'engines/Win32Forth' directory to the 'ffl' directory.

For minForth the config.fs and make.fs files should be copied from the
'engines/minForth' directory to the 'ffl' directory.

For iForth the config.fs and make.fs files should be copied from the
'engines/iForth' directory to the 'ffl' directory.

For spf the config.fs and make.fs files should be copied from the
'engines/spf' directory to the 'ffl' directory.

The next step is editing the config.fs file for system settings.


At the moment there are four system setting: 

end-of-line

This word defines the ascii end of line as a counted string. For unix this 
is a linefeed, for dos systems it is carriage return and linefeed. For
gforth, fina and iForth the end of line is supplied by the forth engine,
so no manual configuration necessary. For bigforth, pfe and minForth the
default is the unix end of line, for Win32Forth and spf the default is dos.
You should change the 'end-of-line' word if the default is not correct for you.

Note: gforth 0.6.2 returns for dos an incorrect value for end-of-line, so
if you use gforth 0.6.2 on dos, you should change the 'end-of-line' word.


#bits/byte

This word defines the number of bits in a byte. The library queries the
forth environment for "address-unit-bits". If this is not present, the
value defaults to 8. In the unlikely event that your system does not
support the environment query and your system uses a different number of 
bits in a byte, then you should change this word.


#bits/cell

This word defines the number of bits in a cell. The default is the number of
bits in a byte multipied by the number of bytes in a cell.


#bits/char

This word defines the number of bits in a char. The default is the number of
bits in a byte multipied by the number of bytes in a char.


Testing
-------

After installing the source files the unit test sources in the 'test'
directory can be run to test the library. The test can be started by:

(for PFE there are command line arguments. These are for test 
purposes only and have no real meaning. Enter them in the correct case.)


(for gforth):

1. Change the current directory to the 'test' directory
2. Enter: gforth ffl_test.fs


(for bigforth):

1. Change the current directory to the 'test' directory
2. Enter: bigforth ffl_test.fs


(for pfe)

1. Change the current directory to the 'test' directory
2. Enter: pfe ffl_test.fs -ab -c TEST --verbose --file=FILE input


(for Win32Forth)

1. Use an editor to remove the 'bye' from the 'ffl_test.fs' file.
2. Start Win32Forth.
3. Use in the window the 'chdir' word to move to the 'test' directory.
4. Use 'include ffl_test.fs' to run the tests.


(for minForth)

For running the tests the minForth engine is configured too small:
1. Extend the engine by editing the kernel.mfc file from minForth. Change 
   in this file the NAMES to 512000, the HEAP to 640000, the LIMIT to 1000000,
   the SPMAX to 256 and the RPMAX to 256. Then rebuild the minForth engine.
2. Copy this new engine (mf and mf.i) to the 'test' directory. Also make sure 
   that in this directory the 'ffl' is installed.
3. Start the minForth engine (mf).
4. Enter: 'include ffl_test.fs'.


(for iForth)

1. Use an editor to remove the 'bye' from the 'ffl_test.fs' file.
2. Change the line 'tst-reset-tests' to 'include ffl/tst.fs  tst-reset-tests'
3. Start iForth.
4. Use the 'cd' word to move to the $IFORTH/examples/ffl-0.6.0/test directory 
5. Do 'include ffl_test.fs' to run the tests.


(for spf)

1. Start a command or cmd window.
2. Change the current directory to the 'test' directory.
3. Enter (including the quotes): "\Program Files\spf4" ffl_test.fs


The program will tell you which modules are tested and if there were any
errors. If you see: 'Forth Foundation Modules Test: 0 errors in xxxx tests.'
then all went well.


Documentation
-------------

In the directory 'html' there is the HTML documentation of the library. The
file 'index.html' contains an overview of all the modules in the library. In 
the file 'words.html' all words of the libary are alphabetically listed. In
the file 'manual.html' there is simple manual.

On the site there is also a link to the manual. This is actually a wiki with 
more information about the library.


Porting to other forth systems
------------------------------

The library is developped on gforth and pfe. The intention is that only two 
files are dependant on the (ANS) forth system:

 ./ffl/config.fs
 ./ffl/make.fs

All other source files should only use ANS words or extensions that are 
present on the forth engine or are definied in the config.fs.

If you change these files to make the library work on a particular forth 
system, let me know, then I can add the changed files to the distribution. 
Also if there are any specific details concerning installation or testing 
for a particular forth system, let me know. I will add them to the README.


Bugs
----

Because the library is still beta it is not impossible that you will find 
bugs. You can send them or any suggestions to the email address which is 
listed on the site: ffl.dvoudheusden.net.


Thanks.
