== ANS Labelling ==

The Forth Foundation Library is written in ANS-standard forth. But it requires some 
extensions. All those extensions are listed in one config source file which is forth 
engine specific. One exception is the word: {{{include}}} _filename_. This word 
is used to include all modules. This is not a big problem, because this word is 
quite common in forth engines.
