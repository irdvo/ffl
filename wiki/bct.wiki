#summary binary cell tree module
=== Module Description ===
The bct module implements an unbalanced binary tree with the key and data
cell based. The implementation is non-recursive.

=== Module Words ===
==== Binary tree structure ====
*bct%* ( -- n )
 Get the required space for a bct variable
==== Tree creation, initialisation and destruction ====
*bct-init* ( bct -- )
 Initialise the tree
*bct-(free)* ( bct -- )
 Free the nodes from the heap
*bct-create* ( "{{{<}}}spaces{{{>}}}name" -- ; -- bct )
 Create a named binary tree in the dictionary
*bct-new* ( -- bct )
 Create a new binary tree on the heap
*bct-free* ( bct -- )
 Free the tree node from the heap
==== Member words ====
*bct-length@* ( bct -- u )
 Get the number of elements in the tree
*bct-empty?* ( bct -- flag )
 Check for an empty tree
*bct-compare@* ( bct -- xt )
 Get the compare execution token for comparing keys
*bct-compare!* ( xt bct -- )
 Set the compare execution token for comparing keys
==== Tree words ====
*bct-clear* ( bct -- )
 Delete all nodes in the tree
*bct-insert* ( x1 x2 bct -- )
 Insert data x1 with key x2 in the tree
*bct-delete* ( x1 bct -- false | x2 true )
 Delete key x1 from the tree, return the cell data x2
*bct-get* ( x1 bct -- false | x2 true )
 Get the data x2 related to key x1 from the tree
*bct-has?* ( x1 bct -- flag )
 Check if the key x1 is present in the tree
*bct-execute* ( i*x xt bct -- j*x )
 Execute xt for every key and data in the tree
*bct-execute?* ( i*x xt bct -- j*x flag )
 Execute xt for every key and data in the tree until xt returns true
==== Inspection ====
*bct-dump* ( bct -- )
 Dump the tree node structure

\ Example1: store mountain height in a binary tree with numerical keys

\ The mountain enumeration

begin-enumeration
  enum: MountEverest
  enum: MontBlanc
  enum: MountElbrus
  enum: Vaalserberg
end-enumeration


\ Create the binary tree on the heap and store it in the heights variable

bct-new value heights


\ Add the mountain heights in the tree; the key is the mountain enum value

8300 MountEverest heights bct-insert
4819 MontBlanc    heights bct-insert
5642 MountElbrus  heights bct-insert


\ Find a mountain height in the tree

MontBlanc heights bct-get [IF]
  .( Mount:mont blanc height:) . cr
[ELSE]
  .( Mount:mont blanc not in tree.) cr
[THEN]

Vaalserberg heights bct-get [IF]
  .( Mount:vaalserber height:) . cr
[ELSE]
  .( Mount:vaalserberg not in tree.) cr
[THEN]


\ Free the heights tree from the heap

heights bct-free



\ Example2: store mountain height in a binary tree with string keys


\ Create the binary tree in the dictionary

bct-create mountains


\ Setup the compare word for comparing the mountain names

: mount-compare  ( str str - n = Compare the two mountain names )
  str^ccompare
;

' mount-compare mountains bct-compare!


\ Add the mountain heights to the binary tree; the key is the mountain name in a (unique) dynamic string

8300 str-new dup s" mount everest" rot str-set  mountains bct-insert
4819 str-new dup s" mont blanc"    rot str-set  mountains bct-insert
5642 str-new dup s" mount elbrus"  rot str-set  mountains bct-insert


\ Find a mountain height in the binary tree

str-new value mount-name

s" mont blanc" mount-name str-set

mount-name mountains bct-get [IF]
  .( Mount:)        mount-name str-get type 
  .(  height:)      . cr 
[ELSE]
  .( Mount:) mount-name str-get type .(  not in tree.) cr
[THEN]


s" vaalserberg" mount-name str-set

mount-name mountains bct-get [IF]
  .( Mount:)        mount-name str-get type 
  .(  height:)      . cr 
[ELSE]
  .( Mount:) mount-name str-get type .(  not in tree.) cr
[THEN] 


\ Word for printing the mountain heights

: mount-emit ( x x -- = Print mountain )
  str-get type ."  --> " . cr
;


\ Print all mountain heights

' mount-emit mountains bct-execute       \ Execute the word mount-emit for all entries in the tree


\ Example binary tree iterator

\ Create the tree iterator in the dictionary

mountains bci-create mount-iter          \ Create an iterator named mount-iter on the mountains tree


\ Using the iterator

mount-iter bci-first [IF]
  .( First mount:) mount-iter bci-key drop str-get type 
  .(  height:)     . cr 
[ELSE]
  .( No first mountain.) cr
[THEN]

mount-iter bci-last [IF]
  .( Last mount:) mount-iter bci-key drop str-get type 
  .(  height:)    . cr
[ELSE]
  .( No last mountain.) cr
[THEN]


\ Cleanup the tree

mountains bct-clear
