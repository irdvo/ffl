module enables the Forth engine to show a GTK GUI. Also a base64, a
scanf and fixed width data module are added to the library. Four
modules were extended with new words. The library will now also run
on VFX Forth and on 64bit Forths. See the ChangeLog for more details.</p>

<p>Seventh release, version 0.7.0, of the Forth Foundation Library. The
library is extended with a finite state machine, a generic binary tree, 
a gzip file reader, a lineair and circulair buffer, a bit input stream, a 
logger and a simple sprintf module. Five modules are extended with 
new words. The regular expression module now also supports user 
classes.  Also the library will now run on iForth32, SPF4 and lxf/ntf.
