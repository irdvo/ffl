                     The Forth Foundation Library (FFL)
                     ----------------------------------


The Forth Foundation Library is a general purpose forth library. It gives you
a collection of words written in (ANS) Forth, in areas such as data types,
collections, development support, interfaces and more compound modules.

At the moment the library is still under development. The FFL library and the test 
words are licensed under the GNU GPL.


The library is developped with gforth. The intention is that only two files
are dependant of the forth system:

 ./ffl/config.fs
 ./ffl/make.fs


If you change these files to make the library work on a certain forth system,
let me know, then I can add the changed files to the distribution.

Because the library is still beta it is not impossible that you will find bugs. 
You can send them or any suggestions to the email address which is listed 
on the site: ffl.dvoudheusden.net. This is also the place for new versions, news, 
documentation etc.

Thanks.
Dick van Oudheusden
